## Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting patterns of extreme poverty using geospatial and socio-economic data. As an **Analytics Engineer**, the primary goal was to uncover key factors driving poverty and provide actionable insights to support targeted interventions.

## Objectives

- Analyze global poverty trends using geospatial and socio-economic datasets.
- Build and evaluate predictive machine learning models to identify countries at high risk of extreme poverty.
- Recommend strategic actions based on model results to aid poverty alleviation efforts.

## Key Features

- **Machine Learning Modeling**: Developed predictive models using Python to analyze the impact of various factors on extreme poverty.
- **Geospatial Data Integration**: Combined spatial and socio-economic data to provide a comprehensive view of poverty distribution.
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Delivered insights to support policymaking and strategic planning for poverty reduction.
